## Reporting a Vulnerability

If ther are any vulnerability, report it by creating a issue and answering the questions 
`What`, `Why`,`Which version`, `When` and `How to replicate it`.

[Here](https://github.com/SujalChoudhari/Neptune.js/issues) you can see and check that if the issue exists.

Mostly the issues are fixed in the upcoming versions.
